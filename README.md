# Project Euler by [kthatoto](https://github.com/kthatoto)

## Rules
1. Set specific numbers as variables, **not** using `stdin`.
1. When solving the `n`th problem, create a file named `./problem_000n/<language>/main.<extension>`(4 digits).
1. If I get the correct answer, make a hash by sha1 of it(**without new line**). And put it as `./problem_000n/hash` on the problem root.
1. In accordance with "one-minute rule" of Project Euler, program should get the answer in one minute.
