# Project Euler by [kthatoto](https://github.com/kthatoto)

## Rules
1. Set specific numbers as variables, **not** using `stdin`.
1. In accordance with "one-minute rule" of Project Euler, program should get the answer in one minute.
1. Basically, using modules/libraries is forbidden. But IO module and basic/minimal calculation library are exceptions.
1. When solving the `n`th problem, create a file named `./problem_000n/<language>/main.<extension>`(4 digits).
1. If I get the correct answer, make a hash of it(**without new line**) by sha1. And put it as `./problem_000n/answer_hash`.
1. If I have multiple solutions, files should be `main.<extension>`, `main2.<extension>`...
