## Rules
1. Set specific numbers as variables, **not** using `stdin`.
1. When solving the `n`th problem, create a file named `./problem_000n/<language>/main.<extension>`(4 digits).
1. If I get the correct answer, make a hash by sha1 of it. And put it as `./problem_000n/hash` on the problem root.
1. In accordance with "one-minute rule", program should get the answer in one minute.
